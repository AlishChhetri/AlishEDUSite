## <font color="#0058AB"> SE1: Programming Over Time </font>

#### Summary

The preface section of the SE book focuses on distinguishing the terms “software engineering", “programming” and “computer science”. The section proposes that “software engineering” encompasses not just the act of writing code, but all of the tools and processes an organization uses to build and maintain that code over time. It also places an emphasis on holding software engineers to the same level of rigor as other engineering disciplines. The programing over time section briefly goes over those points while introducing three fundamental principles that software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, and writing their code. These principles encompass considerations of time and change, how code will need to adapt over the length of its life; scale and growth, how an organization will need to adapt as it evolves; and trade-offs and costs, how an organization makes decisions, based on the lessons of Time and Change and Scale and Growth.

#### Reflection

The preface and programming over time sections outline the foundation for the book's exploration of software engineering with insights from Google's unique perspective. I believe this will not only give us an understanding of the material but also a look into how the industry, particularly Google, looks at software engineering and what level of rigor they expect.

#### Use-Case

The knowledge gained from these sections can be applied to any aspect of the Chasten project, as well as to all other programs we write. The emphasis on holding software engineers to the same level of rigor as other engineering disciplines requires us to think beyond the specific use-case of a tool we develop. This ability to apply ourselves rigorously and holistically is crucial in ensuring the success in the field of software engineering.

# Week 5

## <font color="#0058AB"> SE4: Knowledge Sharing </font>

#### Summary

The [Knowledge Sharing](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch03.html) chapter in the SE book highlights the idea of organizations understanding their own problem domain and being equipped to answer their own questions. This involves having both experts with knowledge and effective mechanisms to disseminate that knowledge. These mechanisms range from simple actions like asking questions and documenting knowledge to more structured approaches like tutorials and classes. Crucially, fostering a culture of learning within the organization is essential, and this necessitates creating an environment where individuals feel psychologically safe to admit when they lack knowledge.

In addition, the chapter underscores the challenge of "Information islands," which represent knowledge fragmentation occurring in different parts of an organization that do not communicate with one another or utilize shared resources. In such an environment, each group develops its own unique way of approaching tasks and challenges. This phenomenon often leads to several critical issues:

- Information Fragmentation: Within these isolated "islands," there exists an incomplete understanding of the larger organizational context and objectives, resulting in suboptimal decision-making.

- Information Duplication: The lack of communication between these groups leads to the duplication of efforts, as each island independently reinvents solutions and processes.

- Information Skew: These islands may adopt varying approaches to address the same issues, potentially causing conflicts and inconsistencies when their methodologies intersect.

#### Reflection

Overall, this chapter underscores the significance of knowledge as a critical asset for software engineering organizations. Fostering a culture of open and honest knowledge sharing, underpinned by psychological safety, is essential for organizational resilience and growth.

## <font color="#B03A2E"> FB4: Mutation Analysis </font>

#### Summary

The [Mutation Analysis](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/MutationAnalysis.html) chapter of the Fuzzing Book presents an alternative approach to evaluate the efficiency of a test suite: by introducing mutations, which are simulated defects, into the code and then examining whether the test suite can identify these simulated defects. The underlying concept is that if the test suite cannot detect these artificial mutations, it is likely to overlook actual software bugs as well.

In addition, the chapter emphasizes a limitation of structural coverage measures, which solely measure code execution without verifying the correctness of program outputs. For instance, the presence or absence of assertions in test cases may not affect coverage metrics, even if the test cases fail to validate correct program behavior. Two example test functions, ineffective_test_1 and ineffective_test_2, illustrate this issue:

```python
def ineffective_test_1():
    execute_the_program_as_a_whole()
    assert True

def ineffective_test_2():
    try:
        execute_the_program_as_a_whole()
    except:
        pass
    assert True
```

These tests may achieve 100% code coverage but are ineffective at discovering actual bugs.

To address this problem, the chapter hints at the idea of injecting bugs into the program to evaluate test suite effectiveness. However, it acknowledges the challenges in doing so, including the potential bias introduced by developers and the time-consuming nature of manually creating these bugs. Consequently, the chapter highlights the need for more robust approaches to ensure the utility of test suites.

#### Reflection

The concept of mutation analysis introduced in the Fuzzing Book's chapter offers a valuable perspective on assessing the effectiveness of test suites. It underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on structural coverage measures, as these may not guarantee the correctness of program outputs. The provided code examples, ineffective_test_1 and ineffective_test_2, vividly illustrate the disparity between achieving high coverage and actually uncovering bugs within the software.

Furthermore, the chapter's discussion on the challenges of injecting artificial bugs raises important considerations about the practicality and potential bias associated with such an approach. This information highlights the need for a balanced and comprehensive testing strategy that not only targets code coverage but also prioritizes the detection of real-world software defects.

#### Use-Case

This chapter's insights into test suite evaluation emphasize the need to complement structural coverage measures with mutation analysis, offering a more robust approach to software testing. By introducing simulated defects and assessing whether the test suite can detect them, we can identify vulnerabilities that structural coverage alone might overlook. It's crucial to recognize that structural coverage metrics should not be the sole focus; instead, we should prioritize comprehensive testing that validates software correctness and robustness. This may require adjustments to our testing methodologies and practices. By incorporating mutation analysis and a holistic testing approach, we can strengthen our projects, enhance software quality, and grow as proficient developers, ultimately delivering more reliable and user-friendly software products.

## <font color="#B03A2E"> FB5: Mutation-Based Fuzzing </font>

#### Summary

The [Mutation-Based Fuzzing](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/MutationFuzzer.html) chapter of the Fuzzing Book introduces the idea of mutational-based fuzzing, a technique used in software engineering testing. It involves making small, random modifications to valid inputs to explore a wider range of program behaviors while maintaining their structural integrity. Mutational fuzzing is particularly valuable in testing software that interacts with external data sources, such as file parsers, network protocols, or APIs. This approach helps identify edge cases, uncover hidden software bugs, and ensure the robustness and reliability of programs that process various inputs.

The chapter provides an example of mutation based fuzzing in the following code blocks:

```python
def mutate(s: str) -> str:
    """Return s with a random mutation applied"""
    mutators = [
        delete_random_character,
        insert_random_character,
        flip_random_character
    ]
    mutator = random.choice(mutators)
    # print(mutator)
    return mutator(s)
```

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(repr(mutate("A quick brown fox")))
```

```
example output:

'A qzuick brown fox'
' quick brown fox'
'A quick Brown fox'
'A qMuick brown fox'
'A qu_ick brown fox'
'A quick bXrown fox'
'A quick brown fx'
'A quick!brown fox'
'A! quick brown fox'
'A quick brownfox'
```

The mutate function take a string as an input and applies a random mutation to it by choosing from a set of mutator functions: delete_random_character, insert_random_character, and flip_random_character. It uses the random.choice function to randomly select one of these mutators and then applies it to the input string. The provided loop prints ten randomly mutated versions of the input string, "A quick brown fox." The example output shows us how the input text can be modified, however you can still clearly tell what the original input was, thus demonstrating the mutation of existing content and not generation of new content.

#### Reflection

The Mutation-Based Fuzzing chapter of the Fuzzing Book introduces mutational-based fuzzing as a practical technique for software engineering testing. It emphasizes the significance of maintaining structural validity in input modifications, allowing for more precise exploration of a program's behaviors. The provided code example illustrates the process of mutating existing content, highlighting the approach's ability to generate subtle variations while retaining the original context. This chapter showcases the value of mutational fuzzing in enhancing software robustness, particularly in scenarios involving external data sources, and serves as a reminder of the importance of nuanced testing methods that go beyond basic input validation.

PEGs prioritize ordered choice, whereas Earley parsers exhibit adaptability across various grammar structures. It underscores the significance of grammars in parsing, emphasizing the creation of derivation trees, nuances in constructing PEGs, and the flexibility of Earley parsers in handling diverse context-free grammars. Overall, this chapter highlights the fundamental role of grammars in both parsing and generating strings through distinct parsing techniques, fostering a deeper understanding of their practical applications.

```python
class PEGParser(Parser):
    def parse_prefix(self, text):
        cursor, tree = self.unify_key(self.start_symbol(), text, 0)
        return cursor, [tree]
```

```python
mystring = "1 * (2 + 3.35)"
for tree in peg.parse(mystring):
    assert tree_to_string(tree) == mystring
    display(display_tree(tree))
```

The code snippet uses the PEGParser to parse a given string, verifying the precision of the resulting tree structure through an assertion test. Additionally, it presents a visual representation, which is displayed alongside the code snippet.

#### Reflection and Use-Case

The Parsing Inputs chapter introduces PEG and Earley parsers, highlighting their distinct parsing methods. Integrating these techniques into Chasten could greatly improve its pattern recognition within Python AST. By employing these methods, Chasten could create more accurate linting rules, offering precise pattern identification without relying on complex AST frameworks or limited regular expressions, thereby enhancing its code evaluation.
